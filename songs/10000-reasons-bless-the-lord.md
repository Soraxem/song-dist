**Chorus**  
Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul  
Worship His holy name  
Sing like never before, O my soul  
I'll worship Your holy name  

**Verse 1**  
The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning  
It's time to sing Your song again  
Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me  
Let me be singing when the evening comes  

**Chorus**  
Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul  
Worship His holy name  
Sing like never before, O my soul  
I'll worship Your holy name  

**Verse 2**  
You're rich in love and You're slow to anger  
Your name is great and Your heart is kind  
For all Your goodness, I will keep on singing  
Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find  

**Chorus**  
So bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul  
Worship His holy name  
Sing like never before, O my soul  
I'll worship Your holy name  
Bless you, Lord  

**Verse 3**  
And on that day when my strength is failing  
The end draws near and my time has come  
Still, my soul will sing Your praise unending  
Ten thousand years and then forevermore  
Forevermore  

**Chorus**  
Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul  
Worship His holy name  
Sing like never before, O my soul  
I'll worship Your holy name  
Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul  
Worship His holy name  
Sing like never before, O my soul  
I'll worship Your holy name  
Yes, I will worship Your holy name  
Lord, I'll worship Your holy name  

**Outro**  
Sing like never before, O my soul  
I'll worship Your holy name  
Jesus, I will worship Your holy name  
Worship Your holy name
