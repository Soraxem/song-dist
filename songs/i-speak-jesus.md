**Strophe 1**  
I just want to speak the Name of Jesus  
Over every heart and every mind  
I know there is peace within Your presence  
I speak Jesus  

**Strophe 3**  
I just want to speak the Name of Jesus  
‘Til every dark addiction starts to break  
Declaring there is hope and there is freedom  
I speak Jesus  

**Refrain**  
Your name is power  
Your name is healing  
Your name is life  
Break every stronghold  
Shine through the shadows  
Burn like a fire  

**Strophe 3**  
I just want to speak the Name of Jesus  
Over fear and all anxiety  
To every soul held captive by depression  
I speak Jesus  

**Bridge**  
Shout Jesus from the mountains  
And Jesus in the streets  
Jesus in the darkness over every enemy  
Jesus for my family  
I speak the holy name Jesus  

**Outro**  
I just want to speak the Name of Jesus  
Over every heart and every mind  
Cause I know there is peace within  
Your presence  
I speak Jesus
