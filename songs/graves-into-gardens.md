**Strophe 1**  
I searched the world  
But it couldn't fill me  
Man's empty praise  
And treasures that fade  
Are never enough  

Then You came along  
And put me back together  
And every desire  
Is now satisfied  
Here in Your love (Hey)  

**Chorus**  
Oh, there's nothing better than You  
There's nothing better than You  
Lord, there's nothing  
Nothing is better than You  
(Oh, yes I know it's true)  

**Strophe 2**  
I'm not afraid  
To show You my weakness  
My failures and flaws  
Lord, You've seen 'em all  
And You still call me friend

'Cause the God of the mountain  
Is the God of the valley  
There's not a place  
Your mercy and grace  
Won't find me again  

**Chorus**  
Oh, there's nothing better than You  
There's nothing better than You  
Lord, there's nothing  
Nothing is better than You  
(I know it's true)  

**Chorus**  
Oh, there's nothing better than You  
There's nothing better than You  
Lord, there's nothing  
Nothing is better than You  

**Bridge 1**  
You turn mourning to dancing  
You give beauty for ashes  
You turn shame into glory  
You're the only one who can  

**Bridge 1**  
You turn mourning to dancing  
You give beauty for ashes  
You turn shame into glory  
You're the only one who can  

**Bridge 2**  
You turn graves into garden  
You turn bones into armies  
You turn seas into highways  
You're the only one who can  
You're the only one who can  

**Chorus**  
Oh, there's nothing better than You  
There's nothing better than You  
Lord, there's nothing  
Nothing is better than You  

**Chorus**  
Oh, there's nothing better than You  
There's nothing better than You  
Lord, there's nothing  
Nothing is better than You  

**Bridge 2**  
You turn graves into gardens  
You turn bones into armies  
You turn seas into highways  
You're the only one who can  
You're the only one who can  
You're the only one who can
